## Project Background
Investing in movie and television production requires significant **financial resources** and **coordination of a large workforce**. Nonetheless, the reality is that **not every project turns out to be commercially successful or profitable**. 

Our team plans to use machine learning to **identify audience preferences and trends**. If this approach works, it could help **reduce the risk of production failures**. With the abundance of available data, we aim to demonstrate how making decisions based on consumer preferences can **enhance the likelihood of success**.

### Business Goal:
To be able to **sustainably identify popular topics** among audiences and **predict the success of prospective films**. 

### Objectives:
1. Train a **text classification model** to predict the sentiment of a movie review, to automate the labelling of the sentiment for new movie reviews on IMDB.
2. Perform **topic modelling** on the movie reviews to uncover insights on the **topics prevalent in positive reviews and likewise for negative reviews**.
3. Train a **binary classification model** to predict **if a prospective films would be well be rated**.
4. Train a **regression model** to predict prospective films’ IMDB votes and hence its potential **audience engagement level**.

### Success Criteria:
- To automate the classification of new movie reviews with a 80% accuracy
- To identify at least 2 topics that are associated with positive sentiment
- Predict for a prospective film, at 60% accuracy rate or a normalised RMSE of 0.2 for its IMDB score and IMDB number of votes

## Work Accomplished
The repository outlines the effort made towards Business Objective #3: 3. Train a **binary classification model** to predict **if a prospective films would be well be rated**.

The goal is to automate the process of predicting if a particular new movie would be well rated by IMDB.

The work accomplished for the other business objectives are detailed in the following sites:

### Data Understanding
The dataset comprises 5,806 individual records of Netflix movies and shows, with each record represented by 11 distinct data fields. The information is sourced from IMDB and is organized in a tabular format.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Dataset visualised via basic panda head and info method

2. Secondly, an EDA table function (modified from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/keishibata/netflix-movies-and-shows-eda-wordcloud](https://www.kaggle.com/code/keishibata/netflix-movies-and-shows-eda-wordcloud)) was utilized to analyze the dataset, focusing on the count of missing values, the number of unique values, and the statistics generated by the pandas describe method for each feature.

3. EDA using ydata-profiling was employed to quickly generate histogram visualizations of the available features and to uncover any insights that might have been overlooked in the initial exploratory data analysis steps.

4. Finally, supplementary visualizations were created to complement the histograms produced by ydata-profiling and to provide a more detailed exploration of the input and target (imbd score) variables.

5. Addition visualizations were done for features such as year of release, runtime of movies/shows. Country of production ranked based on number of movies/shows produced

### Data Preparation

Duplicate entries were removed based on both the title AND the release year. This approach addresses the common occurrence of remakes sharing the same title, ensuring that each instance is treated as a distinct record during modeling. Additionally, records with missing values in the target variable were removed.

Subsequently, we remove entries that do not make logical sense
•	Records without target variable
•	Records with runtime that is = 0

The dataset includes information on both movies and television shows. While movies typically have a shorter runtime, shows may be broadcast over multiple seasons or episodes. Therefore, it is proposed to combine runtime and seasons into a single feature, 'runtime_combined', to more accurately represent the total duration of each title.

One hot encoding was also performed on categorical features
•	Type (Movie vs Show)
•	Genres
•	Production country
•	Content rating
•	Year of movie release

Additional Feature engineering
•	The first production country listed was mapped to its corresponding continent to simplify the number of dimensions, while other production countries were excluded.
•	Content ratings were grouped into bins to consolidate similar age bands and reduce dimensionality.
•	The year of movie release was binned into three equal-sized intervals.
•	Features not intended for modeling were removed at this stage.

Feature engineering step specific to objective 3
• Converted IMDB score valeus into data by creating a new column "worth_watching?". Movies and shows with IMDB score greater or equal to 7 were labelled as “worth_watching” while <7 as “waste of time”.
